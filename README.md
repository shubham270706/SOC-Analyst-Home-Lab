# 🛡️ SOC Analyst Home Lab

## 🔍 Overview
This project documents my journey in building a home-based **Security Operations Center (SOC)** lab.  
The goal is to simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios and practice threat detection, analysis, and response.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Simulate cyberattacks using Kali Linux
- Monitor logs and alerts using Wazuh and Kibana
- Build familiarity with SOC workflows and tooling
- Document each phase for learning and future reference
